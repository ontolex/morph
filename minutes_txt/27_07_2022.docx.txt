Model draft 4.16 updates (to be discussed) & open issues:

  • 
        inflection type to be discussed

  • 
        overall, it seems people have least issues with alternative 1

      □ 
            CC: alternative 1 or 2 for agg. languages (0 and 3 => combinatorial
            explosion)

      □ 
            MP: alternative 1 (or 3) (0 fails, 2 has terminological issues)

      □ 
            KG: need link with GrammaticalMeaning

      □ 
            on-going discussion: rename GrammaticalMeaning (esp., if used for
            slots or finite states)?

  • 
        after telco:

      □ 
            CC: alternative 1 with KG-requested additions suggested as 4.16
            (not confirmed)

          ☆ 
                InflectionType: alternative 1

          ☆ 
                grammaticalMeaning: linked with inflection rule and inflection
                type (with question marks, link with inflection type requested
                by Penny&Katerina)

          ☆ 
                Rule resurrected (only to simplify diagram: holds properties
                replacement, involves and examples, inherited by inflection
                rule and word formation rule)

      □ 
            expression of interest and short abstract handed in:

          ☆ 
                describe and compare modelling of MWEs in OntoLex core, decomp,
                FrAC, *and morph* (~compounding)

          ☆ 
                primarily designed as a FrAC paper, but input from morph
                contributors would be welcome (LiLa?)

              ○ 
                    Matteo&Elena: in principle interested, will look into that

          ☆ 
                cf. open issues from earlier minutes

              ○ 
                    describe the relation between decomp and CompoundRelation

                  ■ 
                        suggestion: do this as part of writing a designated
                        paper [venue?]

                  ■ 
                        TODO@unassigned: document relation between both modules
                        in appendix

                      ★ 
                            there is an alternative reification with
                            decomp:Component, but this is less well-suited for
                            compound analysis, because it doesn’t relate to
                            lexicosemantic relations.

                      ★ 
                            the current modelling of decomp is oriented towards
                            an analysis of synsem (semantic) roles within a
                            compound. in morphology, we normally don’t have
                            that, what we have, instead, are relations between
                            lexemes and morphemes.

                    idea for novel paper: word formation in OntoLex-Lemon

                  ■ 
                        not original content, but more like a survey and
                        documentation of best practices?

                  ■ 
                        can be helpful to consolidate/revise word formation

                open an issue

          ☆ 
                pull request + close the issue

  • 
        status:

      □ 
            pull requests by Matteo and Penny merged

      □ 
            draft contains now a number of notes

      □ 
            more consolidation needed

      □ 
            todo: revise/confirm morpheme typology in lexinfo (suggested by
            Sina)

2.2 overview

  • 
        continue model overview for Elena B., Sina and Petra: Inflection part

      □ 
            Max: morphs are not morphemes, but can also be extrapolated from
            fullform dictionary (~allomorphs)

      □ 
            Petra: this is like Harris-Firth approach? Distributionalism?

      □ 
            CC: definitions are technical (= self-contained), not linguistic.
            we try to avoid commitments to any specific theory, concepts should
            still be intuitively comprehensible by linguists

      □ 
            Max Ionov: In this specific use case, almost. But we try to stay
            approach-independent. We just want to provide means to model _any_
            data

      □ 
            CC: two main scenarios

          ☆ 
                model an existing morpheme inventory or rule set (e.g., for
                generation, then, morphs are not automatically created)

          ☆ 
                induce morphs/rules and store them (and then use them as in the
                first scenario for morphological generation)

      □ 
            inflection type may be need to be revised

2.3 replacement (wrapup)

conventions for replacement correspond to those of pattern matching/replacement
in SPARQL, as formally defined

  • 
        in SPARQL 1.1 (https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/), which points to

      □ 
            the XPath function replace (https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#
            func-replace), and

      □ 
            the XPath regex syntax (https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-functions/#
            regex-syntax)

A more readable, informal description under

  • 
        https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPARQL/Expressions_and_Functions#REGEX

Note that in the formal syntax definition, “\” is used to mark special
characters. However, as most SPARQL engines are Java-based and Java uses “\” as
an internal escape symbol, you actually have to write “\\” instead of “\” as
defined in the syntax. A literal single “\”-character in a regex must thus be
double escaped (i.e., “\\\\”).

Note: This syntax originates from regular expressions in Perl (https://
perldoc.perl.org/perlre).

Except for minor differences in escaping and special characters, this is
equivalent to

  • 
        the syntax of regular expressions in Java (https://www.w3schools.com/
        java/java_regex.asp)

  • 
        the syntax of regular expressions in Sed (https://www.gnu.org/software/
        sed/manual/html_node/Regular-Expressions.html) (and other Unix
        command-line tools, e.g., grep)

2.4 InflectionType

  • 
        current definitions:

      □ 
            Class morph:InflectionType represents a single slot for a single
            grammatical category for all its possible values (e.g. all the
            cases)

          ☆ 
                Book analogy: a column from a paradigm table without allomorphy
                /alternative variants for just a single morpheme

      □ 
            property morph:inflectionType assigns an inflectional pattern of a
            form as belonging to a morphological pattern of a lexical entry

  • 
        CC (offline): this definition does not work for the current diagram, if
        one inflection type represents the position for *all* cases, we cannot
        associate the form for, say, dative with the rule for dative via
        inflection type (thanks to Matteo for pointing that out).

      □ 
            https://github.com/ontolex/morph/issues/11

  • 
        Comparing alternatives:

      □ current model

         1.
                Form -inflectionType-> InflectionType

         2.
                Paradigm <-paradigm- InflectionType

         3.
                InflectionType -inflectionRule-> InflectionRule

         4.
                InflectionType -next-> InflectionType

      □ 
            alternative 0: keep current model, one inflection type per paradigm
            and rule

    pro: backward-compatible

    con: unneccessarily verbose: what is the difference to inflection rule
    then?

    con: still contradicts current definition

  • alternative 1: detach InflectionType

     1.
            Form -inflectionRule-> InflectionRule

     2.
            Paradigm <-paradigm- InflectionRule

     3.
            InflectionRule -inflectionType-> InflectionType

     4.
            InflectionType -next-> InflectionType

    pro: we basically keep all the information we have, incl. finite state
    modelling and agglutination

    con: inflection type won’t be used for fusional languages and probably fall
    out of use

    con: terminologically, the finite state use case is still a bit of a
    stretch, a better name?

    note: paradigms should be allomorphy-free, then (this is at odds with
    traditional usage of “paradigm”. in inflection tables, it normally includes
    allomorphic variants.

  • alternative 2: replace InflectionType by GrammaticalMeaning

     a.
            Form -inflectionRule-> InflectionRule

     b.
            Paradigm <-paradigm- InflectionRule

     c.
            InflectionRule -grammaticalMeaning-> GrammaticalMeaning

     d.
            GrammaticalMeaning -next-> GrammaticalMeaning

    pro: we basically keep all the information we have, incl. finite state
    modelling and agglutination

    pro: we eliminate one class and we address a feature request by Penny

    pro: slot information can be plausibly a part of grammatical meaning (or,
    better, structure)

    con: no explicit data structures for slots, researchers would need to
    “discover” that from comments => rename next to nextSlot?

    con: for FST, this is very opaque, a better name? => we could introduce a
    designated subclass “FiniteState” of GrammaticalMeaning !?

  • alternative 3: merge InflectionType with InflectionRule

     a.
            Form -inflectionRule-> InflectionRule

     b.
            Paradigm <-paradigm- InflectionRule

     c.
            InflectionRule -grammaticalMeaning-> GrammaticalMeaning

     d.
            InflectionRule -next-> InflectionRule

    pro: we keep all the information we have, incl. finite state modelling and
    agglutination

    pro: we eliminate one class and address a feature request

    pro: “rule” is more relatable to what a finite state does than “inflection
    type” (which sounds static)

    con: no explicit data structures for slots, researchers would need to
    “discover” that from comments

    con: in agglutinating languages, the sequence is not over replacement
    rules, but classes of morphemes, so we lack a formal data structure for
    slots

    con: for FST, this conflates states and replacements, normally one state
    can have different replacements (“rules”)

Penny+Katerina (summary of last call, tests for fusional language):

  • 
        all alternatives express the neccessary information (if a direct link
        with grammatical meaning is added)

  • 
        prefer alternative 2

      □ 
            alternatives 1 and 3 are equivalent if a direct link with
            grammatical meaning is added

      □ 
            alternatives 1-3 preferred over current model in terms of verbosity

  • 
        CC: that corresponds to my personal preference, too

  • 
        CC: minor refinements (to be discussed after applicability to
        agglutinative language has been shown)

  • 
        rename GrammaticalMeaning to “Features” (or “FeatureBundle”; a “slot”
        is described as a bundle of features, so that makes sense, and finite
        states are informally associated with some kind of function, but
        typically not a specific grammatical meaning, esp. for
        morphophonological processes)

  • 
        introduce a subclass FiniteState of FeatureBundle (we would informally
        capture the finite state itself as a feature, and the bundle would
        consist of exactly one such feature)

confirm on agglutinative languages

  • 
        sample data (Turkish) from Christian on GitHub under data/agglutinating
        /turkish.md

      □ 
            to be discussed in detail next time

      □ 
            preference (in terms of verbosity) for alternatives 1 or 2

      □ 
            alternatives 0 and 3 lead to combinatoric explosion

  • 
        Matteo:

      □ 
            strong preference against alternative 0

      □ 
            others are unproblematic

      □ 
            not happy with slots as “grammatical meaning”, could mismatch

          ☆ 
                Christian: we can rename, see remarks from last time

      □ 
            preference to alternative 1 (or 3)

  • 
        after discussion:

      □ 
            CC: possible workaround would be to create a class FeatureBundle
            with sub-classes GrammaticalMeaning, Slot and FiniteState

          ☆ 
                “inflection type” caused a lot of misunderstandings, so maybe
                use “Slot” instead, and really only for slots.

          ☆ 
                “next” formally defined for Feature bundle, but is relevant for
                Slot and FiniteState only

          ☆ 
                property “grammaticalMeaning” needs to be renamed then, too,
                maybe “morph:feats”, subproperties grammaticalMeaning (range is
                GrammaticalMeaning) and inflectionType (range is Slot)

  • 
        CHECK STATUS: define morph subclasses in LexInfo rather than

            identical in meaning, etc.

          ☆ 
                suggestion: model the grouping by lexicog, have both the
                overarching lexical entry and the flexemes as separate lexical
                entries, no vocabulary extension needed, but a usage note in

            Penny: sub-entries of the same lexical entry to mark contracted and
            non-contracted versions of the same paradigm

          ☆ 
                can be partially modelled by means of “markers”, i.e., lexinfo
                usage properties, instead

          ☆ 
                todo@Penny: tbc. whether lexinfo needs to be extended for that

              ○ 
                    domain: LexicalSense

              ○ 
                    TODO: ask John

              ○ 
                    if these properties are added, no sub-groups necessary

  • 
        @all: think about metadata properties for LexInfo (hypothetical/
        unattested form, etc.) => tentative consensus, but details to be
        discussed

      □ 
            Penny: could work, but domain is ontolex:LexicalSense. Can this be
            changed?

      □ 
            mentioned by Sina last time

      □ 
            tentative consensus: no special vocabulary needed, but should be
            confirmed on sample data

3.1 Comparison with MMoOn (Mod. Greek, Hebrew, other; unassigned)

  • 
        Bettina’s data (link?)

  • 
        not directly comparable, current Gk. data is inflectional

3.2 baseConstraint + grammatical Meaning + baseType

  • 
        Sina (sample date from Central Kurdish)

    :ish_morph a clitic / endoclitic; # lexinfo:Clitic ???

    ontolex:sense [ skos:definition “too, also” ];

    ontolex:canonicalForm [ ontolex:writtenRep “îş” ];

    morph:baseConstraint [ :pos "v", "n", "a" ] .

    :sh_morph a ontolex:Affix, lexinfo:Suffix . # allomorph of “îş”

  • 
        Christian: sample data from Inuktitut (GDrive) (https://github.com/
        ontolex/morph/raw/master/data/gdrive/Polysynthetic_Inuktitut.docx)

    atausiulugu

    {atausi:atausiq/1n}{u:u/1nv}{lugu:lugu/tv-part-1s-3s-fut}

    {one}{existence; is}{part. future: while I ...him/her/it}

    :atausiq_le a ontolex:LexicalEntry;

    ontolex:sense [ skos:definition “one” ];

    ontolex:canonicalForm [ a ontolex:Form; ontolex:writtenRep “atausiq” ];

    ontolex:baseForm [ a ontolex:Form; ontolex:writtenRep “atausi”;
    morph:grammaticalMeaning “n” ].

    :u_morph a ontolex:Affix, lexinfo:Suffix;

    ontolex:sense [ skos:definition “existence; is” ];

    ontolex:canonicalForm [ ontolex:writtenRep “u” ];

    morph:baseConstraint [ :pos “n” ]; # from “1nv”

    morph:grammaticalMeaning [ :pos “v” ]. # from “1nv” : convert noun into
    verb

    # note: this generates a stem, not a word, it only becomes a proper word
    with inflection:

    :lugu_morph a ontolex:Affix, lexinfo:Suffix;

    ontolex:sense [ skos:definition “while …” ];

    ontolex:canonicalForm [ ontolex:writtenRep “lugu” ];

    morph:baseConstraint [ :pos “v” ]; # from “tv-”

    morph:grammaticalMeaning [ :pos “v-part-1s-3s-fut” ].

    :atausiu_le a lexinfo:Stem, ontolex:LexicalEntry;

    ontolex:sense [ skos:definition “so. will be sth.” ];

    ontolex:baseForm [ ontolex:writtenRep “atausiu” ];

    # this is not a free-standing lexeme, and there is no canonical form that
    is a word

    ontolex:lexicalForm [ ontolex:writtenRep “atausiulugu” ;

    rdf:_1 :atausiq_le;

    rdf:_2 :u_morph;

    rdf:_3 :lugu_morph ].

this is purely descriptive, no explicit rules written, but baseConstraint and
grammaticalMeaning allow to check consistency conditions.

Note that Inuktitut inflection involves some level of assimilitation, this is
modelled here by means of baseForm (dropping of -q), but the contexts are not
marked explicitly.

We could easily model that if morph:baseType is in morph:GrammaticalMeaning
rather than in ontolex:Form. That would be necessary if a particular base form
is only generated by a morpheme rather than given for a root/stem.

3.3 Samples to be modelled (all)

  • 
        most sample data originally on GDrive (where is the link?)

      □

      □ 
            Open requirements: IGT/ToolBox/FLeX data, inflection tables!

3.4 inflection tables (Fahad, others?)

  • 
        Latin (?)

  • 
        Old English (Fahad): sample data: coman/quoman example, cf. https://
        en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cuman#Old_English

      □ 
            issues with dialects (reference dialect vs. other dialects) and
            diachrony (phonological processes); treatment of syncopation,
            suppletion, fusion of different roots [=> variants?] ?

  • 
        postponed until Fahad has some progress on modelling

3.5 semitic consonantal roots (unassigned)

  • 
        from the same consonant cluster, we can generate different POSes

  • 
        cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-T-B, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki
        /%D9%83_%D8%AA_%D8%A8)

      □ 
            this cannot (always) be modelled as inflection, as OntoLex requires
            (at most) one POS per lexical entry

      □ 
            note that this page describes vowelized words as “derivatives”: can
            we model this as derivation ? (but the process occurs in
            inflection, too)

          ☆ 
                given a real dictionary, can be easily distinguish derivation
                and inflection?

  • 
        cf. Arabic example from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
        Dictionary_of_Modern_Written_Arabic (from Max)

      □ 
            dictionary organized by roots, but root is not made explicit

      □ 
            todo@unassigned: put an example into GitHub

  • 
        discussion postponed until we have a Semitic speaker

      □ 
            Ilan?

          ☆ 
                but first, check Bettina’s conversion of KDictionaries’ Hebrew
                dict

3. Agenda and TODOs for September

 1.
        Get sample Arabic data and try to model it + look into Bettina’s Hebrew
        data (Sina + Max)

 2.
        Clitics in Kurdish data

 3.
        Clitics in Italian: https://dizionario.internazionale.it/parola/farcela
        + reflexives in Spanish, prefixes in German — use as a single form,
        writtenRep with a space

 4.
        Model agglutinative language data with different alternatives (Max)

 5.
        Ask Khadija if she will join us in September (Fahad)

3. AOB

next call in September
