Model draft 4.15 updates (to be discussed) & open issues:

  • 
        Head/CompoundingHead/CompoundHead stays → it’s okay to change it for
        homogenity

      □ 
            Matteo: Head misleading, could be suffix in derivation

      □ 
            Maybe we could rename the class completely, not using “Head”.
            DONE@CC: create an issue on GH: https://github.com/ontolex/morph/
            issues/10

      □ 
            majority vote: stay with CompoundHead

      □ 
            TODO@all: discuss and maybe come up with the solution

  • 
        inflection type to be discussed

  • 
        consistsOf?

      □ 
            tentative consensus:

          ☆ 
                drop consistsOf between morph and morph

          ☆ 
                -”- between form and form

          ☆ 
                keep between form and morph

          ☆ 
                add aggegator relation between form and morph (=> rdfs:_1 etc.
                to encode position); => redefine ontolex:Form as a Container

          ☆ 
                TODO@all: think about whether you ever used one of the dropped
                consistsOf properties

          ☆ 
                suggestion: when finalizing the vocabulary

      □ 
            CHECK STATUS: define morph subclasses in LexInfo rather than
            OntoLex-Morph, also add equivalence axioms (lexinfo:Prefix
            subclassOf [ lexinfo:termElement lexinfo:prefix ])

          ☆ 
                https://github.com/ontolex/lexinfo/pull/29

          ☆ 
                not merged yet

      □ 
            unassigned: describe the relation between decomp and
            CompoundRelation

          ☆ 
                suggestion: do this as part of writing a designated paper
                [venue?]

          ☆ 
                TODO@unassigned: document relation between both modules in
                appendix

              ○ 
                    there is an alternative reification with decomp:Component,
                    but this is less well-suited for compound analysis, because
                    it doesn’t relate to lexicosemantic relations.

              ○ 
                    the current modelling of decomp is oriented towards an
                    analysis of synsem (semantic) roles within a compound. in
                    morphology, we normally don’t have that, what we have,
                    instead, are relations between lexemes and morphemes.

      □ 
            describe grouping of lexical (sub-) entries

          ☆ 
                LiLa: “flexeme”, sub-entries with different paradigms, but
                identical in meaning, etc.

              ○ 
                    suggestion: model the grouping by lexicog, have both the
                    overarching lexical entry and the flexemes as separate
                    lexical entries, no vocabulary extension needed, but a
                    usage note in the report

              ○ 
                    tbc: by LiLa

          ☆ 
                Penny: sub-entries of the same lexical entry to mark contracted
                and non-contracted versions of the same paradigm

              ○ 
                    can be partially modelled by means of “markers”, i.e.,
                    lexinfo usage properties, instead

              ○ 
                    todo@Penny: tbc. whether lexinfo needs to be extended for
                    that

                  ■ 
                        domain: LexicalSense

                  ■ 
                        TODO: ask John

                  ■ 
                        if these properties are added, no sub-groups necessary

      □ 
            @all: think about metadata properties for LexInfo (hypothetical/
            unattested form, etc.) => tentative consensus, but details to be
            discussed

          ☆ 
                Penny: could work, but domain is ontolex:LexicalSense. Can this
                be changed?

2.1 InflectionType

  • 
        current definitions:

      □ 
            Class morph:InflectionType represents a single slot for a single
            grammatical category for all its possible values (e.g. all the
            cases)

          ☆ 
                Book analogy: a column from a paradigm table without allomorphy
                /alternative variants for just a single morpheme

      □ 
            property morph:inflectionType assigns an inflectional pattern of a
            form as belonging to a morphological pattern of a lexical entry

  • 
        CC (offline): this definition does not work for the current diagram, if
        one inflection type represents the position for *all* cases, we cannot
        associate the form for, say, dative with the rule for dative via
        inflection type (thanks to Matteo for pointing that out).

                paradigm and rule

    pro: backward-compatible

    con: unneccessarily verbose: what is the difference to inflection rule
    then?

    con: still contradicts current definition

Example for fusional language:

Notes:

1. we have assumed that grammatical meaning (single feature or bundle of
features) is a property on inflection rule based on previous discussions and
example at https://docs.google.com/document/d/
1iCv865GtEksO_wd0WC7bfU-at1dEKOOea9HSlFcTTkA/edit

2. Question for cardinality of inflection type: can it take multiple
inflectional paradigms? This is useful in case the same combination of stem and
ending with the same grammatical features is used in other inflectional
paradigms: for instance, for Greek the inflectional paradigm "vrahos" is
similar to "efyvos" but with only one stem; so, the form for nominative
singular is derived from exactly the same combination (stem 1 & ending "ος")
for both paradigms.

     3.
            InflectionRule -inflectionType-> InflectionType

     4.
            InflectionType -next-> InflectionType

    pro: we basically keep all the information we have, incl. finite state
    modelling and agglutination

    con: inflection type won’t be used for fusional languages and probably fall
    out of use

    con: terminologically, the finite state use case is still a bit of a
    stretch, a better name?

    note: paradigms should be allomorphy-free, then (this is at odds with
    traditional usage of “paradigm”. in inflection tables, it normally includes
    allomorphic variants.

Example for fusional language

Notes:

1. as pointed by Christian, for fusional languages, inflection type indeed is
not used.

2. similar question on cardinality as for current model: can we have multiple
paradigms on inflection rule?

  • alternative 2:

    replace InflectionType by GrammaticalMeaning

 a.

 b.
        Paradigm <-paradigm- InflectionRule

 c.
        InflectionRule -grammaticalMeaning-> GrammaticalMeaning

 d.
        GrammaticalMeaning -next-> GrammaticalMeaning

    pro: we basically keep all the information we have, incl. finite state
    modelling and agglutination

    pro: we eliminate one class and we address a feature request by Penny

    pro: slot information can be plausibly a part of grammatical meaning (or,
    better, structure)

    con: no explicit data structures for slots, researchers would need to
    “discover” that from comments => rename next to nextSlot?

    con: for FST, this is very opaque, a better name? => we could introduce a
    designated subclass “FiniteState” of GrammaticalMeaning !?

Example for fusional language

Notes: for fusional languages, this is the same as for alternative 1, since the
inflection type is not used.

  • alternative 3: merge InflectionType with InflectionRule

     a.
            Form -inflectionRule-> InflectionRule

     b.
            Paradigm <-paradigm- InflectionRule

     c.
            InflectionRule -grammaticalMeaning-> GrammaticalMeaning

     d.
            InflectionRule -next-> InflectionRule

    pro: we keep all the information we have, incl. finite state modelling and
    agglutination

    pro: we eliminate one class and address a feature request

    pro: “rule” is more relatable to what a finite state does than “inflection
    type” (which sounds static)

    con: no explicit data structures for slots, researchers would need to
    “discover” that from comments

    con: in agglutinating languages, the sequence is not over replacement
    rules, but classes of morphemes, so we lack a formal data structure for
    slots

    con: for FST, this conflates states and replacements, normally one state
    can have different replacements (“rules”)

Example for fusional language

Notes: for fusional languages, this is the same as for alternative 1, since the
inflection type is not used.

CC (before public discussion): my favorite would be alternative 2, with the
following modifications:

  • 
        rename GrammaticalMeaning to FeatureBundle (a “slot” is described as a
        bundle of features, so that makes sense, and finite states are
        informally associated with some kind of function, but typically not a
        specific grammatical meaning, esp. for morphophonological processes)

  • 
        introduce a subclass FiniteState of FeatureBundle (we would informally
        capture the finite state itself as a feature, and the bundle would
        consist of exactly one such feature)

Penny+Katerina:

  • 
        alternatives 1-3 are equivalent (because of the direct link with
        grammatical meaning => alternative 2)

  • 
        all preferred over current model in terms of verbosity

2.2 morph(eme) order

  • 
        CC: this is an old problem we always postponed, forgot to mention last
        time

  • 
        consistsOf

      □ 
            currently

          ☆ 
                ambiguous: form -> form, form -> morph, morph -> morph

          ☆ 
                doesn’t represent order

      □ 
            suggestion:

          ☆ 
                replace by aggregation (rdfs:Seg or rdfs:Bag)

          ☆ 
                define a form as an aggregate of morphs

          ☆ 
                no such relation between form -> form and morph -> morph

          ☆ 
                instead of morph -> morph: because morph is a lexical entry, we
                go from morph -> form, and then use “consistsOf” equivalent at
                form level

          ☆ 
                instead of form -> form: use form -> morph and assign the
                “sub-forms” as lexicalForm to the morph

      □ 
            has the original “consistsOf” ever been used by anyone before?

  • 
        tentative consensus:

      □ 
            drop consistsof between forms and morphs, keep between form and
            morph

      □ 
            plus: define ontolex:Form as container (seq) of morphs

      □ 
            NB: we need consistsOf to mark morphological segments in case
            somebody else defiunes a form as an aggegrate of sth else

2.3 replacement

(If we have misunderstood, and the following are already covered, feel free to
remove.)

Taken from the Finnish example https://docs.google.com/document/d/
1iCv865GtEksO_wd0WC7bfU-at1dEKOOea9HSlFcTTkA/edit: morph:replacement
[morph:source "$", morph:target "ssa"]

This looks more like a concatenation of source and target string, rather than a
replacement.

We suggest that the pattern in the source string is repeated at the target
string,

e.g. morph:replacement [morph:source "$", morph:target "$ssa"]

This will allow for supporting (1) the addition of a string before and after
the source pattern at the same time and (2) replacement of the source string
with a totally new string.

Case 1: The motivation for this comes from "augmentation" in modern Greek,
which is an extra character added at the beginning of verbs in past tenses (cf.
http://www.xanthi.ilsp.gr/filog/ch6/gram/vpc3.asp) together with a suffix in
the generated form. Although in the LEXIS lexicon, we treat past forms with
augmentation as simply a different stem, similar cases may also exist in other
languages. A simplified example for 1st person, past imperfective ('e-treh-a')
and past perfective ('e-trex-a') forms, is:

<inflRule_Id01PaIm> a morph:InflectionRule ;

morph:paradigm <trehw_paradigm> ;

morph:baseType "1" ;

morph:replacement

# [ morph:source ".*" ; morph:target "έ&α"@el ] .

[ morph:source "^(.*)$" ; morph:target "έ\1α"@el ] .

morph:grammaticalMeaning <Id01PaIm> .

<inflRule_Id01PaPe> a morph:InflectionRule ;

morph:paradigm <trehw_paradigm> ;

morph:baseType "2" ;

morph:replacement

# [ morph:source ".*" ; morph:target "έ&α"@el ] .

[ morph:source "^(.*)$" ; morph:target "έ\1α"@el ] .

morph:grammaticalMeaning <Id01PaPe> .

Case 2: For specific words with irregular inflectional paradigms, e.g. the
definite article "o", cf. https://www.foundalis.com/lan/definart.htm it looks
like we have two options: add all inflected forms on the lemma, without
generating them, or add an inflectional paradigm with one stem (the lemma
itself) that appears as the source string replaced by all other forms as target
strings. Simplified paradigm:

## stem: "ο" generates "o"

<inflRule_MaSgNo_defart> a morph:InflectionRule ;

morph:paradigm <defart_paradigm> ;

morph:baseType "1" ;

morph:replacement

[ morph:source "$" ; morph:target "$"@el .

morph:grammaticalMeaning <MaSgNo> .

## stem: "ο" generates "του"

<inflRule_MaSgGe_defart> a morph:InflectionRule ;

morph:paradigm <defart_paradigm> ;

morph:baseType "1" ;

morph:replacement

[ morph:source "$" ; morph:target "του"@el .

morph:grammaticalMeaning <MaSgGe> .

3.2 inflection tables (Fahad, others?)

  • 
        Latin (?)

  •

        en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cuman#Old_English

      □ 
            issues with dialects (reference dialect vs. other dialects) and
            diachrony (phonological processes); treatment of syncopation,
            suppletion, fusion of different roots [=> variants?] ?

  • 
        postponed until Fahad has some progress on modelling

3.3 semitic consonantal roots (unassigned)

  • 
        from the same consonant cluster, we can generate different POSes

  • 
        cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-T-B, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki
        /%D9%83_%D8%AA_%D8%A8)

      □ 
            this cannot (always) be modelled as inflection, as OntoLex requires
            (at most) one POS per lexical entry

      □ 
            note that this page describes vowelized words as “derivatives”: can
            we model this as derivation ? (but the process occurs in
            inflection, too)

          ☆ 
                given a real dictionary, can be easily distinguish derivation
                and inflection?
