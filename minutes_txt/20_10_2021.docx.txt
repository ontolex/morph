 1.
        Module draft 4.5

[image2]

Included adaptations:

  • 
        renamed object property morph:hasParadigm to morph:paradigm

  • 
        renamed object property morph:hasInflection to morph:inflectionType

  • 
        renamed object property morph:generates between morph:InflectionRule
        and ontolex:Form to morph:inflects and changed the range to morph:Morph

  • 
        removed the ex:1 restriction on morph:generates

Adaptations of module draft 4.5 to be included for next telco:

  • 
        CC: note that we also need a corresponding rule to morph for derivation
        relation and compound relation (that is, unless we permit Morph as
        subject of vartrans:source and take multiple sources)

      □ 
            BK: proposal: remove morph:generates between
            morph:WordFormationRule and ontolex:LexicalEntry (because it seems
            to me as if it tries to represent the creation of the blank blank
            node that contains the combination of the derivation/compound
            elements while the resulting ontolex:LexicalEntry resource is then
            the product of what is specified in this blank node) and instead
            create the object property morph:contains (for example) between
            morph:WordFormationRelation and morph:Morph

General scope of the morph module vocabulary:

BK proposal:

  • 
        include vocabulary that describes static morphological data

  • 
        exclude vocabulary or modeling elements that are involved in the
        dynamic process of generating new (static) morphological data, e.g.
        blank nodes and/or object properties that can be misunderstood as
        “creating” or “generating” new resources and statements - instead
        represent morphological data generation processes with workflow
        diagrams

      □ 
            MI: use different namespace for data generation processes

      □ 
            MI: in favour of 2 separate diagrams - one for static data
            representation and one for generation process representation

      □ 
            JC: in favour of releasing one diagram containing everything

      □ 
            CC: execution of rules is out of scope of the model but the
            definition of rules should be contained

:MorphPattern → morph:InflectionType, morph:WordformationRelation

:MorphTransform → morph:InflectionRule, morph:WordFormationRule

:Prototype → blank node resulting from application of morph:InflectionRule and
morph:WordFormationRule
