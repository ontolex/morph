Representing composition: OntoLex decomp vs. morph module

 1.
        Problem statement

In contrast to the existing OntoLex-lemon modules, the morphology module shall
enable the representation and generation of automatically generated decomposed
morphological data of ontolex:LexicalEntry and ontolex:Form resources. This
involves the representation of linguistic elements in inflectional and
word-formation processes. While inflection and derivation will constitute novel
representation possibilities within the morph module, the representation of
composition has been dismissed so far due to the existing means to represent
decomposition with the decomp module.

However, modeling needs have been raised that point to insufficiencies within
decomp and will result in substantial representational overlap between the
morph and decomp/vartrans modules if these will be covered within the morph
module:

modeling requirements:

 1.
        word-formation relations

 2.
        word-formation rules

 3.
        interrelation between relations and rules

 4.
        declaration of morphs involved in word-formation

 5.
        interrelating more than exactly one source lexical entries with a
        target lexical entry

decomp limitations:

 1.
        no reification of the relation between lexical entries involved in
        composition because there are no direct links with morphological rules
        to state that there are two word-formation processes (i.e. relations)
        involved (only that a lexical entry is composed of a set of
        constituents)

 2.
        compensation with vartrans vocabulary: vartrans:lexicalRel: “The
        lexicalRel property relates two lexical entries that stand in some
        lexical relation.” → only one source lexical entry

→ the relations between the compound elements are provided in the vartrans
module even though the word-formation processes for compounding (= decomp) and
derivation (=vartrans) are treated homogeneously

example:

Latin: word-formation of “agipes”:

  • 
        involving 2 compounding relations

  • 
        containing the lexical entries “ago” and “pes”

  • 
        that are both individually related to “agipes” and

  • 
        one compounding rule "ago + pes = agipes”.

WFL uses a step-by-step morphotactic approach. Each word formation process is
treated individually, and the lexeme resulting from WFR is usually richer
(containing more morphemes) than the input.

        Solution proposal

Include the representation of composition in the morph module:

 1.
        Create top level class morph:WordFormationRelation with subclass
        morph:CompoundingRel “A compounding relation is a relation that relates
        one or more source lexical entries with a target lexical entry.”

 2.
        Adapt definition, domain and range of vartrans:source and
        vartrans:target to allow more than one resource as source and also
        ontolex:Form and morph:Morph as domain or range. → not really required
        anymore, relations can be split binary if a compound contains more than
        2 components

→ allow both modules to represent composition:

lexeme-based (= decomp and morph) and morpheme-based (=morph only) approach

        Implications

  • 
        morph module might be superseding decomp module

  • 
        clear distinction between decomp and morph module required:

    Rules of thumb:

  • 
        if information about lexemes without order, use decomp module, for
        general-purpose lexicography, decomp would suffice

  • 
        if information about morphs together with order and/or details of
        morphophonology (thema vowel, interfixes), use morph module (requires
        the modeling of order) (or if you want to enrich your resource at a
        later stage)

  • 
        future morph module datasets need to be downward compatible

 4.
        Discussion

  • 
        both module vocabularies have to be compatible

      □ 
            one should not supersede the other module

      □ 
            use decomp as default and morph for enrichment?

      □ 
            integrate morph module vocabulary into decomp and vartrans so that
            morph fills the representational gap → might result in adapting
            existing decomp and vartrans vocabulary (would be ok)

  • 
        the modules represent two different views on morphology; decomp
        decomposes the output of the compound and morph decomposes input and
        output with relation and rules → would result in separate the modules
        that might still overlap

  • 
        probably resources exist that use both ways of representing
        decomposition

  • 
        Julia> two possible solutions: if describing two different views on
        morphology, having two separate modules makes sense, if wa aim for a
        more fine-grained version of decomp, then they need to be more closely
        related (one as an extension of the other)

  • 
        Marco> two modules that can live together and are not redundant ( -->2
        different views or approaches)

  • 
        Analogy with lexicog - core modules. There is a “rule of thumb” of
        using lexicog only for representation needs that cannot be covered by
        the core module. Here, it could be the same: use decomp if this cover
        your needs, if not, use morph

 5.
        Decision

→ develop morph module independent of existing docomp/vartrans vocabulary for
dedicated purpose of representing generated morphological language data

  • 
        add disclaimer as in lexicog module: only use morph if you know that
        you are doing

  • 
        as long as both modules are used for different use cases there is no
        problem (no superseding, overlap or incompatibility) - we have to make
        clear for what use case decomp and morph are applicable and that morph
        is more complex

  • 
        no integration of the morph module into decomp/vartrans but keep all
        separate for different use cases (and define them clearly)
