 1.
        Module draft 4.5.1

  • 
        removed morph:generates between morph:WordFormationRule and
        ontolex:LexicalEntry (advantage of morph:generates was to allow
        interrelations between ontolex:LexicalEntry resources and their
        underlying word formation processes in a general way without requiring
        the statements of lexicosemantic relations for the entailed sources and
        target resources)

  • 
        added morph:WordFormationType which represents the process (e.g. verb
        to noun) and morph:WordFormationRule represents the actual way of
        implementing it

      □ 
            JMC:Relation is between two specific lexical entries (compute/
            computer). Type represents the linguistic process (add -(e)r). Rule
            is a computational implementation (add "r" to end of string).

CC tried to convert data with 4.5.1, evaluation:

  • 
        WordformationType and WordFormationRule are hard to distinguish in
        practice and increase the size of data has been created without clear
        added value

  • 
        object property between WordWormationRelation and Morph missing

 2.
        Module draft 4.5.2

  • 
        morph:Morph as subclass of ontolex:LexicalEntry

  • 
        results in morph:sense and morph:evokes being unnecessary (removed)

sample conversion of (complete) German UDer data under https://github.com/

CC tried to convert data with 4.5.2, evaluation:

  • 
        vatrans:source could be used because Morph is a subclass of
        LexicalEntry

  • 
        WordFormationType class was not necessary

URI: http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/ontolex#LexicalEntry

A lexical entry represents a unit of analysis of the lexicon that consists of a
set of forms that are grammatically related and a set of base meanings that are
associated with all of these forms. Thus, a lexical entry is a word, multiword
expression or affix with a single part-of-speech, morphological pattern,
etymology and set of senses.

SubClassOf: lexicalForm min 1 Form, canonicalForm max 1 Form,
semiotics:Expression

URI: http://www.w3.org/ns/lemon/vartrans#source

The source property indicates the lexical sense or lexical entry involved in a
lexico-semantic relation as a 'source'.

 3.
        Module draft 4.5.3

  • 
        added object property morph:contains (for example) between
        morph:WordFormationRelation and morph:Morph

[image2]

Adaptations of module draft 4.5 to be included for next telco:

  • 
        CC in favour of combining 4.5.2 and 4.5.3 because reduced redundancy to
        have morph:Morph as a subclasss of ontolex:LexicalEntry and since
        vartrans:source has the restriction “subClassOf: relates exactly 2
        (ontolex:LexicalEntry OR ontolex:LexicalSense OR
        ontolex:LexicalConcept)” the additional morph:contains property in
        draft 4.5.3 is required

  • 
        changes:

      □ 
            start with 4.5.2: Morph sub LexicalEntry

      □ 
            add contains (not more than 2 vartrans:relates/source/target
            properties)

      □ 
            morph value as lexicalForm

      □ 
            merge ontolex:LexicalEntry and ontolex:Morph subclasses

      □ 
            allomorphs => otherForm

      □ 
            morpheme “value” => canonicalForm

      □ 
            ?rename morph:consistsOf?

  • 
        other changes:

      □ 
            not discussed, but CC in favor of eliminating the reundancy between
            DeroivationRelation and DerivationRule

      □ 
            do we need generates, if we have WordFormationRelations

addenda (post-call)

  • 
        CC: while converting sample data for composition, I was struggling *a
        lot*.

      □ 
            GermaNet uses n-ary compounds, if these are to be represented as a
            LexicoSemanticRelation (which is binary), the only way is to say
            for every subterm invidually that the subterm is source and that
            the compound is target. In this way, we loose order

      □ 
            we loose any information about which consituent is the
            morphological head (this is annotated in GermaNet)

      □ 
            how does a CompoundRule work if it does not access all subterms =>
            I guess it must have access to all subterms, but it is hard to see
            how to write a replacement rule if the number of subterms and their
            order is unknown

          ☆ 
                if it does not have access to all subterms, but only to one
                suberm and the resulting compound, we cannot write replacement
                rules either

          ☆ 
                I consider this basically unsolvable. but with morph subclass
                of LexicalEntry, we can resort to decomp, here. we would
                probably not have a CompoundRule, then, but a CompoundRelation
                (to mark the morphological head)

      □ 
            as a last resort, we might restrict generative morphology to
            inflection and derivation, only. no compound rule, then

Todos:

  •

        CC: provide example for Universal Derivations converted data with draft
        4.6

      □ 
            DONE: commented data snippet under https://github.com/acoli-repo/
            acoli-morph/blob/main/uder/Readme.md

      □ 
            NB: sample data for UniMorph (inflection) under https://github.com/
            acoli-repo/acoli-morph/tree/main/unimorph
