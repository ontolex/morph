0. Orga

  • 
        consolidated wiki and documentation

      □ 
            diagram sources and minutes now mirrorred under https://github.com/
            ontolex/morph

  • 
        draft definitions under https://github.com/ontolex/morph/blob/master/
        draft.md, (to be) continuously updated

      □ 
            restructured into logical sections

      □ 
            completed (according to diagram), but no additional definitions
            created

TODO (@all): Add definitions that are not there or outdated



1. Module draft

    draft 4.11 (old layout & reformatted)

[image2]

[image1]

Model draft 4.11 updates & questions

  • 
        changed display of datatype properties (as in UML)

  • 
        round edges replaced by squared edges (in order to work with online
        editor)

  • 
        morph:replacement points to a class Replacement which takes source and
        target datatype properties (as modelled in Thierry’s paper)

  • 
        Question: shouldn’t LexicalEntry (except as superclass of morph:Morph)
        be an ontolex:Word

      □ 
            TODO: think about this before publishing the final model

      □ 
            MI: I think there was a discussion about this in the very beginning
            (about affixes). To check

  • 
        Question: definition of morph:morphophonologicalRelation? (@Penny?)

      □ 
            drop it

  • 
        the arrow for involves is wrong. must be *filled*

Model draft 4.12 updates:

  • 
        grammaticalMeaning also pointing from ontolex:Form to
        GrammaticalMeaning (per request by Matteo and Penny) – mostly for
        filtering convenience

  • 
        stemType moving from LexicalEntry to ontolex:Form

2 Evaluation of inflectional data modeling

2.1 POSTPONED: vartrans:orthVariant (Greek, Penny)

New examples with vartrans:orthVariant as a vartrans:category (found it more
interesting to instead of adding it just as a subproperty). What is still not
clear though is how to define that the two (or more) orthographic variants
share the same senses and syntactic behaviour.

lexis_data:avgo_orthVariants a vartrans:LexicalRelation ;

vartrans:source lexis_data:avgo ;

vartrans:target lexis_data:augo ;

vartrans:category lexis:orthVariant .

Questions:

  • 
        termbase instead of lexis for orthVariant?

  • 
        any relation with `morph:baseForm` ?

Option with lexicog module works but multiplies the lexical entry data, e.g.
senses have to be created for all lexicographic components.

  • 
        consensus

    → to be developed as part of the vartrans module but applied in order to
    connect two ontolex:LexicalEntry resources that only differ in their
    orthographic representation but share the same senses: a
    vartrans:orthVariant subproperty of vartrans:lexicalRel that entails that
    the same senses apply to both variants (restriction has to be formulated)

  • 
        possibilities (last time):

 1.
        create separate entries and link them with a subproperty of
        vartrans:lexicalRel (your_namespace:orthVariant sub
        vartrans:lexicalRel) between two ontolex:LexicalEntries that are
        orthographic variants - the shared data of both would have to be
        repeated for both entries then or it has to be stated only on one
        lexical entry resource (duplicate all senses)

 2.
        alternatively, leave senses of the variant empty, define in the
        semantics of orthVariant that this entails that the same senses apply
        to both variants)

 3.
        use owl:sameAs and share senses (a bit messy, because semantically this
        means they are the same thing)

2.2 POSTPONED: Orthographical variants in Old English (Fahad)

  • 
        was TODO@Fahad: sample data

2.3 Latin inflectional data example by Matteo

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v2M-LbCdrdaPl2LVuPKzOfU-fQjv_5_1/view?usp=
sharing

was this complete?

Representation of inflectional information of orthographic variants:

class: lila:Flexeme (subclass of ontolex:LexicalEntry) are linked to lila:Lemma

lexemes → lexical units with a unique meaning

▶ flexemes → lexical units with a unique form (i.e., a unique inflectional
paradigm)

object property between lila:Lemma: lila:lemmaVariant (subclass of
ontolex:Form)

Matteo continues his presentation on Latin inflection and raises further
questions.

bundles of features

  • 
        grammaticalMeaning can be either a set or a single feature

  • 
        need property between form and grammatical meaning (reification for
        bundles of lexinfo properties)

multiple ontolex:Forms for the same feature bundle?

  • 
        yes, unless purely orthographical

  • 
        but what is purely orthographical is a matter of debate

  • 
        if the underlying resource requires a differentiation, one can also
        create separate forms for orthographic variants

      □ 
            OntoLex: “Different forms are used to express different
            morphological forms of the entry. They should not be used to
            represent ortographical variants, which should be represented as
            different representations of the same form. For example, for the
            lexical entry color, we would have two different representations of
            the same form, one for the British English written representation
            colour and one for the American English written representation
            color. Both representations have the same pronunciation and the
            same meaning, so they are two different lexicographic variants of
            the same lexical entry”

    => if it is not sure whether they have the same pronunciation or meaning, a
    researcher/resource who wants/has to distinguish it can (this is not MUST
    anyway, but SHOULD, so we can deviate under justified circumstances)

  • 
        different base forms for generation

      □ 
            cf. stemType (unsolved yet)

      □ 
            MI: can be illustrated/documented with morph:example (if generation
            with regular expressions is too hard)

      □ 
            Penny: my example is computational, not lexicographical, needed
            there

2.4 morph:stemType (Greek/Latin)

(from modern Greek inflection)

    => morph:stemType (identifier for different stems, also needed for Latin)

    question: why at inflection rule and at ontolex:LexicalEntry ?

cf. Question (CC, 2022-02-23, offline): wouldn't it make more sense to model
stemType at a (base) form rather than at the level of lexical entries?

next week: tbc whether this works for Latin/Matteo

3. Other todos

3.1 OntoLex TermElement vs. Morph subclasses

  • 
        https://www.w3.org/community/ontolex/wiki/Morphology#
        Fixed_set_of_morph:Morph_classes:_Telco_12.05.2021

  • 
        https://github.com/ontolex/lexinfo/issues/21

  • 
        question: extend lexinfo (and abandon morph subclasses) or morph
        subclasses (and replicate lexinfo) ?

      □ 
            the current modelling with some subtypes of morph(eme)s modelled as
            subclasses and others as TermElements is inconsistent
