Connection to Morph

[image1]

Problems (?):

 1.
        Recursive forms

 2.
        Detachable affixes (clitics)

 3.
        ???

Bettina notes:

  • 
        morph:MorphologicalPattern replaced with max:Paradigm (different naming
        but the same)

  • 
        morph:InflectionalParadigm replaced with max:InflectionType

  • 
        Proposal works for derivation and inflection, question: double the
        vocab for inflection and derivation or choose a new more neutral (and
        maybe more technical) vocabulary that covers both processes?

  • 
        Where is the data for max:InflectionType and max:Rule coming from?!
        What is the minimal dataset to apply this generation process? A:
        dataset should contain forms, inflection types and rules.

To do for next telco:

Max prepare documentation for how to create all forms of a finnish noun in for
one case. Including: description of input data (in ontolex RDF or other
structured data), description of how to use presented modelling, SPARQL query
for the generation process and what the created output data would look like.
