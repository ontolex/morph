# Naming conventions

# as morph:grammaticalMeaning is a morph:Morph-level feature, the following two lines must be put into different entries
# that means that we need to mint distinct URIs for them. I take the number (.../1...) to identify senses for all homographic morphemes
# in an umambiguous fashion, so a URI of the type CANONICAL_FORM + "_" + NUMBER + "_le" should be unambiguous

# Note: by using grammatical meaning and base constraint, we can ensure proper combinatoric semantics, 
# BUT we cannot indicate whether a form is complete or not: all the verbal forms *require* inflection morphemes

# Inflection morphemes

# for -lugu: conventionally, Inuktitut inflection morphemes for transitive 
# verbs indicate subject and object agreement. -lugu is different in 
# indicating only object agreement (i.e., with absolutive argument)
# However, it is also a shift-reference marker, so it cannot refer to a 
# third person subject, but only to a fourth (obviative/distal third) person subject
# here, we use multiple grammatical meanings to express different agreement patterns

# Lexinfo extensions (as for number/person agreement, there may be better ways to do that)
